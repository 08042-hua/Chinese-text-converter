Plugin for converting Chinese text between Simplified and Traditional in ONLYOFFICE editors

This project aims to develop a plugin for ONLYOFFICE editors that enables users to convert Chinese text between simplified and traditional characters. The plugin will be based on the open-source OpenCC library and may include optional features such as automatic pinyin annotation. This functionality is valuable for cross-border collaboration, translation workflows, and language education, helping users create content tailored to regional preferences or learning needs.
